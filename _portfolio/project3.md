### What is the Combat Tracker?

Well you already have created your Character in Etune so, Why you should keep track of all the stats and attacks of your Character? What if you have more than one? It can get very messy in combat if you don't remember your mechanics but not only messy... It usually gets slow.

Combat in D&D should be tactical but frenetic, you are a monk that has been training 30 years in a temple, How can you forget how much damage your 4 punches do?

Combat Tracker is here to solve these issues as any RPG Turn based combat you will be able to play your Character from the comfort of just a few clicks! Focus on strategies not on remembering numbers.

### New Joiner Friendly

It's kind of obvious... The less you need to remember the easier it is! People that want to try playing D&D will be able to actually enjoy their firsts combats.

Instead of remembering all the formulas that they needed to keep in mind, they will remember how glorious was to kill that evil Goblin and of course adopting the other one... by force.

### But D&D is very Dynamic...

Of course it is, and the Combat Tracker will never limit the experience of an original D&D Combat.

Dungeon Masters will be able to affect however they consider each stat and each throw of each creature, I know from experience that sometimes some balancing has to be made in combat to keep safe our players... 

Let's be honest, this was intended to use the other way aorund, you will be able to add those 100 HP that the wizzard deleted from your BBEG that actually was 80 HP maximum... But don't worry! Just a breath deeply and... Voil√°! Your BBEG is now 300 HP!
