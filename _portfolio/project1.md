### What is the Quest Board?

The **Quest Board** is the meeting point between all **Players** and **Dungeon Masters**. 

It is the tool that **connects** each one of us.

**Dungeon Masters** will create *Quests* that will be reviewed by the ***Etune Dungeon Master Community*** and published in the *Quest Board*.

**Players** will be able to check all the *Quests* and **apply** to the ones interested in.

Each *Quest* will **reward** the party with several rewards like **experience**, **objects**, and **resources** to improve the **Guild**.

If you started your adventure in Etune alone, **you will not be lonely** for much time!
Just apply to a Quest, and meet **new friends** while fighting monsters or discovering mysterious plots with them.

> On the other hand, if you entered Etune with friends don't worry, you can **create a party beforehand** and apply to the Quest **all together**!


### Which are the advantages of having the Quest Board?

There are several advantages like:

- If you join Etune alone the Quest Board will be the best way to get to know new Players!

- If you like D&D but you don't really have time, just find a shor quest / one-shot that will fit in your busy calendar.

- As a DM, you can offer your creativity to other Players by creating Quests for them.

- As a DM, you will join an awesome community of other Dungeon Masters that will help you to create your own Quests.
