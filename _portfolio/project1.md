Let's start by taking a look to this conversation, I'm sure you are familiar with it:

“I would love to try DnD, but i don’t have friends…”\
“I am a dm and I have a game running, join us”\
“But it’s too complicated!”\
“It’s not, i will guide you”\
“I don’t have time!”\
“We only play once a month”\
“But i don’t know how to roleplay…”\
“No one knows!”\
“Well, I will think about it…”\
