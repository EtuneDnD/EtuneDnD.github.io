### Why Passive Playing?

D&D is fun but when the session with the Dungeon Master and the Party ends... You never know when will be the next one! Don't get me wrong that is also exciting, but some of us can never get enough of D&D so... 

**Why not playing after the session ends?**

If you joined a Guild you will able to use the different locations of the Guild Castle to improve your Character or investing time on improving the Guild Castle.

Now you can also play D&D to keep this mechanics leveling up! So you can enjoy a more efficient Guild Castle!
