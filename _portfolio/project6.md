### Freedom for Dungeon Masters

Don't forget that Etune is 2 things, a whole **new D&D world**, and a **set of tools** that will make D&D more enjoyable.

Etune is still D&D and it's meant to be a Table Top RPG experience so Dungeon Masters are still the core of Etune, we will provide you with plenty of tools to impact Etune.

All in Etune will be configurable, new mechanics can be added thanks to the **No-Code platform** that will be available.

Do you want a new **Spell / Object / Combat Mechanic / NPC**? Just build it and deploy it in Etune, as simple as that.

Well is not that simple... Keep reading.

### Is not Dangerous to have so many Dungeon Masters?

You may think that this could be a little bit messy, but Etune aims to be **Community Driven**, each Hombrew idea must be approved by the other DMs as well as the Quests that directly impacts the Main plot of Etune.

This can be seen as a problem, but I see this as an opportunity to **play as a Dungeon Master in a cooperative mode** and also to get help from other Dungeon Masters when needed!
