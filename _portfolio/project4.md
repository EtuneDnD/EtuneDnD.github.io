### What is the Guild Builder?

Why would you be alone in world as big as Etune? I mean you can go alone if you want to! But in Etune you will have the option to be part of a big family, a Guild.

Think of the Guild as group of skilled people that share the same objectives, they have a common place known as the Guild Castle that can be improved by anyone that forms part of it.

If you go into a Quest and you get as a reward money and resources you can use them to improve the Guild, this will give you and the other memebers several advantages.

### What can we level up?

Maybe you want to level up the bazaar so new NPCs and new Stores can trade with the Guild... Or maybe you are a bookworm and you want a bigger library to store the knowledge of Etune... or maybe you want to improve the deffenses of the Guild so you can sleep peacefully at night!

But this is not cheap and you will need to align between the Guild members to focus your efforts.

### Who runs the Guild?

Each Guild comes with a default role hierachy demonstrate that you are the beast leader and Guide the Guild.

If you don't like the role hierarchy just change it! This is still D&D keep it dynamic but always align with your Guild Brothers and Sisters.

### Which are the advantages of joining a Guild?

As you already read there are plenty of them, this advantages will also impact the passive playing.

But the most important part is the more people the better!
