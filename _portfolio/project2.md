### What is the Character Manager?

As any RPG game it all starts by creating your first Character, here in Etune is the same, you start by creating the Character that you will be using for the first Quests.

All actions in Etune can affect your Character so, the Character Manager is in charge of tracking all of those events and stats, even your invetory. 

### Which are the advantages of having your Character registered in Etune?

If your Character is registered in Etune you can forget about all the complicated things related to combat or possesions because each Quest you complete will automatically update your Character Sheet.

But not only that, you can trade your stuff with other Players! Or even with other Guilds!

### Isn't this Character Manager the same as Roll20, D&D Beyond and many others...?

Do not worry my friend, you will be able to import your Characters from these magnificent platforms into Etune. 

This Character Manager is coupled with Etune so, it's not a substitute for Roll20 or D&D Beyond, you can use them at the same time! 

The main goal is too keep track of your Character progress in Etune.

### Is mandatory to use the Character Manager?

NO.

If you are a casual Player then don't worry about registering your D&D Character.But if you want to grow in Etune, It's highly recommended. 

Keep in mind that If you don't register your Character in Etune we won't be able to track the progress and you will lose rewards...
